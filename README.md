# Deep-learning-exercises
This repository contains deep learning with Tensorflow exercises written in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Python libraries used in exercises:
  - Tensorflow
  - numpy
  - sklearn
  - Tensorflow_datasets
  
### Exercises are using MNIST dataset to show an expample of writing Deep Neural Network

### To use MNIST dataset:
```
  import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
  mnist_dataset, mnist_info = tfds.load(name='mnist', with_info=True,as_supervised=True)
```


Code is based on exercises from 'Data Science Course' conducted by Data Science 365.
